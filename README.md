# thorlabs_shutter
python script to control the Thorlabs SC10 shutter controller

once it works it can be turned into a widget to be able to be incorporated in the python gui

to start I used code from:

https://github.com/hebecked/PyDAQ/blob/master/bin/rotational_stage/old/instruments/thorlabs/sc10.py

and
